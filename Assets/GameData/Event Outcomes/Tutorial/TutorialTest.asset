    content: 'It''s good to see you alive pilot. Welcome to black space.

      

      Out
      here on the fringes of the galaxy places of interest are going to be your only
      source of real activity. Make sure to look at your map in the bottom right
      to find these locations. If the area on your scanner is red, that means something
      is hostile, green means (hopefully) friendly. But be careful! The scanners
      don''t get much detail and are really just guessing.

      

      Almost
      everyone out here is infested, so be careful, you''re unlikely to encounter
      a ship that doesn''t want you dead. There''s a big ship headed your way that
      I don''t really want to mess with, so I''ll be sure to get in contact again
      if you''re still alive after fighting it. There''s a countdown next to your
      minimap, it ticks up every two minutes, indicating that stronger infested have
      arrived, when the counter hits five, you''ll have to deal with the big one.

      

      Good
      luck, you''ll probably need it.
