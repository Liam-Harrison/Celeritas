    content: "Ahead of you is a massive battle taking place between what seems to
      be a ragtag alliance of pirates, raiders and even a few military ships, against
      an untold horde of infested. A quick glance tells you that the infested are
      winning by an insurmountable margin. Just as you come to this conclusion an
      enormous explosion rocks your ship, disrupting your sensors and knocking a
      few systems offline. One you manage to get everything restarted you notice
      the survivors are gone, along with a huge chunk of the infested. It seems like
      the alliance wanted to take some of their enemies with them.\r\n\r\nThough
      the infested were devastated by the explosion, their numbers are still overwhelming.
      Even if you try to escape immediately, you\u2019re likely to still have to
      fight at least a few of them to get away. With that said, the rewards for a
      total victory here would be immense, maybe it\u2019s worth trying to wipe them
      out? The battle would be extraordinarily difficult.\r\n"
