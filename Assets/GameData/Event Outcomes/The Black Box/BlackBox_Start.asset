    content: "There seems to a be a ships Black Box drifting through space, with
      no trace of the ship it came from, floating just ahead of you.\r\n\r\nAs you
      approach alarms briefly blare out, warning you of entering restricted airspace,
      before quickly shutting off again. It seems the box was meant to warn civilians
      away from it, but is malfunctioning.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to get
      the black box on board, where you can scan its contents, the results are somewhat
      garbled, but what you can decipher is disturbing. It seems like Cygnius Hub
      knew about this infection a long time ago. Missing ships on the edges of civilised
      space and destroyed military outposts were just the start of it. For years
      the Cygnius navy has been fighting against this infection\u2026 and losing\u2026
      No wonder pirates and raiders have been such a huge problem for so long, the
      navy was too busy getting butchered by their own infected ships to deal with
      them.\r\n\r\nThere must be more to this, but for now all you can do is sigh,
      dismantle the box for a meagre amount of scrap, and continue on your way.\r"
