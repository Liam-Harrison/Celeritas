    title: Bringing them aboard
    content: "You make the call to bring them aboard. After keeping watch for enemy
      ships, you quickly pull them on with the tractor beam. After supplying them
      with concentrated oxygen, they cough and splutter, blood immediately pouring
      from their mouth. It isn\u2019t long before a few gurgles spill out, along
      with the words \u201Cthey\u2019re back\u2026where are...\u201D. The man, an
      elderly Ipan, stops mid sentence and goes limp, his yellow skin greying. His
      pocket jangles, and inside are a number of rare metals that you guiltingly
      take. \n\nAfter a strong silence, a crew member realises in shock that the
      pink infection has spread to her skin. In horror, you begin to fly away just
      in case more of the infection lies in the area. She begins to deteriorate immediately.
      Everyone else starts feeling ill. You all feel a lot weaker and more frail."
