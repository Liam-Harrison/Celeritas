    title: A body appears
    content: "Someone on board screams. A body is drifting outside, soft pinks and
      blues reflecting off their body from the surrounding stars. Wait, no, the pink
      is actually blobs of a strange infection. Their body seems motionless, but
      they aren\u2019t crystallised or frozen. Perhaps they\u2019re actually still
      alive, albeit on the brink of death? The infection pulses, slowly overtaking
      every inch of skin as precious seconds pass."
