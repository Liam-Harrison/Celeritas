    content: "With a seemingly excited \u2018ping!\u2019 your sensors pick up what
      seems to be the signal of an old Enforcer patrol. Whilst their IFF\u2019s still
      seem to be working, broadcasting their status as a functional patrol, it seems
      odd that they arn\u2019t seeming to be going anywhere. Your sensors tell you
      that their engines are offline and their formation is off.\r\n\r\nIt could
      be that they\u2019ve been infested, or they could just been letting discipline
      slip considering the state of the sector.\r"
