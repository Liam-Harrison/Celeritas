    content: "Just ahead of you is the distress signal of what claims to be a shelter
      station, taking in civilians fleeing from the infestation. It seems that the
      station has come under attack, though the distress signal is quite old so things
      arn\u2019t looking good.\r\n\r\nWhen you arrive the scene is horrific. Space
      for kilometres around is chocked in blood and gore, it seems like the station
      itself was chewed open by some absurdly enormous beast. Of the corpses strewn
      all about you witness not a single one that hasn\u2019t been torn into at least
      3 different pieces with globules of blood and viscera forming a disgusting
      orbit around them.\r\n\r\nWhatever did this didn\u2019t just want to kill these
      people, it wanted to utterly destroy them.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is a bit of a struggle
      to salvage anything without throwing up, you are able to grab a module before
      you quickly leave.\r"
