    content: 'As you begin to leave, you receive a comms hail from the ship in question.
      The camera feed flickers to life, revealing a small cockpit drenched in the
      seeping death of the infestation. Sitting, still seemingly alive, in the command
      chair is a terrified looking man, face twisted in pure agony, eyes wide in
      abject horror and legs partially melted into the infestation itself as it slowly
      consumes more and more of his flesh.


      You... May take a while to get
      to sleep tonight.'
