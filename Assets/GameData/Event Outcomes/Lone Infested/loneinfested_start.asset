    title: A lone infested
    content: Your scanners pick up a single small infested ship flying at low speeds
      through blackspace. Whilst a lone infested isn't uncommon nearer to large pockets
      of the infestation, this particular ship seems to be trully out on its own.
    options:
    - type: 0
      content: Destroy it! An easy target for once.
      outcome: {fileID: 11400000, guid: d2042a111b50f0a43b0105c1eed629be, type: 2}
    - type: 0
      content: Leave it alone, it could be bait.
