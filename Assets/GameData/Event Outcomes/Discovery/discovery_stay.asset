    title: Upon investigation
    content: 'Venturing closer, it soon becomes apparent this was a residential ship.
      As you investigate more, a burnt crib floats in your peripheral. A young life
      was lost here.


      A story book detailing the olden days of the solar system,
      when alien life was foreign to it, distracts the crew as they accidentally
      drift into a contaminated piece of metal! It doesn''t seem bad at first, but
      as you fly away, a section of the ship deteriorates and breaks off. That''s
      a bit of damage...the sound of crashes and electrical faults distracts you
      as you somberly fly away.'
