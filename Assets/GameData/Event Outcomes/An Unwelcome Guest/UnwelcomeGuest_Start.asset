    content: "There's a poorly maintained auto-repair station here, no one to talk
      to, but at least you can patch up a bit of the damage to your ship.\r\n\r\nAs
      you hook your ship into the docking clamps and a few drones begin lazily hovering
      towards the various scars and tears along your hull, your sensors pick up a
      few infested ships on approach. If you stick around for the repairs to finish,
      a fight will be unavoidable, but leaving now would forgo any potential repairs.\r"
