    content: 'While reprogramming the drone you notice several failsafes to prevent
      exactly what you''re doing. Whilst you can''t gain the ships total cooperation,
      you can atleast deactivate its weapon systems to allow you to scrap it without
      risk of a weapon misfire.


      Most of the modules on board are designed
      specifically to work with auto-ships, but you do manage to make {0} work.'
