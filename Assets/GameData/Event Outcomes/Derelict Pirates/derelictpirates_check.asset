    content: "After getting closer it becomes clear that the entire fleet was destroyed,
      thoroughly. Hints of the infested can be found through the wreckage, but it
      seems clear that the criminals were intentionally detonating their own ships
      before the infestation could take hold. Checking your scans to your databases,
      it seems only one vessel is missing, the dreadfleets capital ship. \r\n\r\nThe
      Cold Fury was an enormous vessel that hosted the dreadfleets leader, who seemingly
      couldn't bring himself to destroy his favoured vessel while he was presumably
      on board. Now the Infested control the Cold Fury, and someone will have to
      deal with it some day. You manage to scrap {0} modules and move on, carrying
      a little dread yourself.\r"
