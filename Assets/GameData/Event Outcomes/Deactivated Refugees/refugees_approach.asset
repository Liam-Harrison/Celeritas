    title: A derelict fleet
    content: 'It seems this is a trully ancient fleet of refugee vessels, fleeing
      from some ancient war.

      The fleet ran out of fuel and has been drifting
      through black space for who-knows how long.


      You scrap what you can,
      but the ancient metals are corroded and few parts are compatible with your
      own.'
