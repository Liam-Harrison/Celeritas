    content: 'As you enter the orbit of the planet, a quick visual appraisal reveals
      the entire planet has been completely overwhelmed by the infestation. Either
      the infection spreads at impossible speeds or has been around a lot longer
      than you thought.


      As you come to this conclusion, several ships take
      off from the surface and begin to attack.'
